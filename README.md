# selection_sort
Selection sort is an algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.

It is an in-place comparison-based algorithm. The algorithm divides the array into two segments:

The sorted part at the left end.
The remaining unsorted part at the right end.
The algorithm involves finding the minimum or maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array and then placing it in the correct position of the array.
